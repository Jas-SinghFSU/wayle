    /// Get the capabilities of the notification server.
    ///
    /// This call takes no parameters.
    /// It returns an array of strings. Each string describes an optional capability implemented
    /// by the server. The following values are defined by this spec:
    ///
    /// - "action-icons":    Supports using icons instead of text for displaying actions.
    ///                      Using icons for actions must be enabled on a per-notification
    ///                      basis using the "action-icons" hint.
    ///
    /// - "actions":         The server will provide the specified actions to the user. Even if
    ///                      this cap is missing, actions may still be specified by the client,
    ///                      however the server is free to ignore them.
    ///
    /// - "body":            Supports body text. Some implementations may only show the
    ///                      summary (for instance, onscreen displays, marquee/scrollers)
    ///
    /// - "body-hyperlinks": The server supports hyperlinks in the notifications.
    ///
    /// - "body-images":     The server supports images in the notifications.
    ///
    /// - "body-markup":     Supports markup in the body text. If marked up text is sent
    ///                      to a server that does not give this cap, the markup will show
    ///                      through as regular text so must be stripped clientside.
    ///
    /// - "icon-multi":      The server will render an animation of all the frames in a given
    ///                      image array. The client may still specify multiple frames even if
    ///                      this cap and/or "icon-static" is missing, however the server is
    ///                      free to ignore them and use only the primary frame.
    ///
    /// - "icon-static":     Supports display of exactly 1 frame of any given image array.
    ///                      This value is mutually exclusive with "icon-multi", it is a
    ///                      protocol error for the server to specify both.
    ///
    /// - "persistence":     The server supports persistence of notifications. Notifications
    ///                      will be retained until they are acknowledged or removed by the user
    ///                      or recalled by the sender. The presence of this capability allows
    ///                      clients to depend on the server to ensure a notification is seen
    ///                      and eliminate the need for the client to display a reminding function
    ///                      (such as a status icon) of its own.
    ///
    /// - "sound":           The server supports sounds on notifications. If returned, the server must
    ///                      support the "sound-file" and "sound-name" hints.
    ///
    /// New vendor-specific caps may be specified as long as they start with "x-vendor".
    /// For instance, "x-gnome-foo-cap". Capability names must not contain spaces. They are
    /// limited to alpha-numeric characters and dashes ("-").

    ///                      Can be blank.
    ///
    /// * `replaces_id`    - The optional notification ID that this notification replaces.
    ///                      The server must atomically (ie with no flicker or other visual cues)
    ///                      replace the given notification with this one. This allows clients to
    ///                      effectively modify the notification while it's active. A value of

    ///                      notifications.
    ///
    /// * `app_icon`       - The optional program icon of the calling application. See Icons and
    ///                      Images. Can be an empty string, indicating no icon.
    ///
    /// * `summary`        - The summary text briefly describing the notification.
    ///
    /// * `body`           - The optional detailed body text. Can be empty.
    ///
    /// * `actions`        - Actions are sent over as a list of pairs. Each even element in the
    ///                      list (starting at index 0) represents the identifier for the action.
    ///                      Each odd element in the list is the localized string that will be
    ///                      displayed to the user.
    ///
    /// * `hints`          - Optional hints that can be passed to the server from the client program.
    ///                      Although clients and servers should never assume each other supports any
    ///                      specific hints, they can be used to pass along information, such as the
    ///                      process PID or window ID, that the server may be able to make use of.
    ///                      See Hints. Can be empty.
    ///
    /// * `expire_timeout` - The timeout time in milliseconds since the display of the
    ///                      notification at which the notification should automatically close.
    ///                      If -1, the notification's expiration time is dependent on the
    ///                      notification server's settings, and may vary for the type of
