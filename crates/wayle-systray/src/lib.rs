//! System tray management service for StatusNotifier items.
//!
//! This crate provides a service for managing system tray items through the
//! StatusNotifier/SNI protocol and DBusMenu specification. It monitors tray
//! items, handles menu interactions, and provides reactive streams for tray
//! item events and state changes.

/// UI framework adapters for the systray service.
///
/// These adapters enable integration with various GUI toolkits,
/// allowing systray menus to be displayed natively in different frameworks.
