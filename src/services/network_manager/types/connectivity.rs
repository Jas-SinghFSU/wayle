/// The NMMetered enum has two different purposes: one is to configure
/// "connection.metered" setting of a connection profile in NMSettingConnection,
/// and the other is to express the actual metered state of the NMDevice at a
/// given moment.
///
/// For the connection profile only NM_METERED_UNKNOWN, NM_METERED_NO and
/// NM_METERED_YES are allowed.
///
/// The device's metered state at runtime is determined by the profile which is
/// currently active. If the profile explicitly specifies NM_METERED_NO or
/// NM_METERED_YES, then the device's metered state is as such. If the connection
/// profile leaves it undecided at NM_METERED_UNKNOWN (the default), then
/// NetworkManager tries to guess the metered state, for example based on the
/// device type or on DHCP options (like Android devices exposing a
/// "ANDROID_METERED" DHCP vendor option). This then leads to either
/// NM_METERED_GUESS_NO or NM_METERED_GUESS_YES.
///
/// Most applications probably should treat the runtime state NM_METERED_GUESS_YES
/// like NM_METERED_YES, and all other states as not metered.
///
/// Note that the per-device metered states are then combined to a global metered
/// state. This is basically the metered state of the device with the best default
/// route. However, that generalization of a global metered state may not be
/// correct if the default routes for IPv4 and IPv6 are on different devices, or
/// if policy routing is configured. In general, the global metered state tries to
/// express whether the traffic is likely metered, but since that depends on the
/// traffic itself, there is not one answer in all cases. Hence, an application
/// may want to consider the per-device's metered states.
